## üéÆ About the Game
*Hollow Depths* is a 2D pixel-art platformer focused on underground exploration, resource management, and minimalistic progression. You play as a miner digging deeper into the earth across four unique biomes: soil, jungle, ice, and lava. Use ladders strategically to navigate your descent and return, sell rare gems for coins, and upgrade your tools to tackle harder terrain. 

The game features a fully functional shop and economy, health and fall damage mechanics, persistent save/load, and a symbolic ending cutscene. Built for a relaxing but methodical experience ‚Äì without combat, just pure exploration and mining.
