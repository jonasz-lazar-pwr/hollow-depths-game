## üéÆ About the Game
*Hollow Depths* is a 2D pixel-art platformer with deep exploration and resource management elements. You play as a miner digging deep underground in search of precious materials like ammolite and stone. Plan your descent and return to the surface using limited resources such as ladders, and upgrade your gear by trading your findings in the surface shop. The game combines satisfying digging mechanics with strategic resource management, exploration, and character/tool progression through a shop system.
